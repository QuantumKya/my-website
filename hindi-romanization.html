        <h2>Vowels / स्वर</h2>
        <div class="chess-spannle-advanced">
            <p>Vowels in Hindi (other than "a") are attached to consonants to make consonant-vowel pairs, e.g. "ka / क" to "kā / का"</p>
            <p>For demonstrative purposes, the consonant क​ "k" will be used for future vowel examples.</p>
            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">a / अ</p>
                <p>-pronounced "uh" /ə/, as in "sun"</p>
                <p>on consonants, this is the "default" vowel, with the character appearing the same; e.g. क</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%;">ā / आ</p>
                <p>-pronounced "ah" /aː/, as in "blot"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a straight line to the right of the character, e.g. का</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">ē / ए</p>
                <p>-pronounced "eh (canadian)" /e/, as in "maybe"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a lightly curved lines protruding from the top of the character, e.g. के</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">ai / ऐ</p>
                <p>-pronounced "ehh" /ɛː/, as in "fair"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as <b>two</b> lightly curved lines on top, e.g. कै</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">i / इ</p>
                <p>-pronounced "ih" /ɪ/, as in "wick"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a line to the left connected to the character with a curve above, e.g. कि</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">ī / ई</p>
                <p>-pronounced "ee" /iː/, as in "leech"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants also as a connected line, but to the <b>right</b> of the character, e.g. की</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">ō / ओ</p>
                <p>-pronounced "oh" /oː/, as in "orange"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a line to the right of the character with some extra decoration, e.g. को</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">au</p>
                <p>-pronounced "aw" /ɔː/, as in "awesome"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants similarly to "o", but with two lines decorating the vowel, e.g. कौ</p>
            </span>

            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">u</p>
                <p>-pronounced "euh" /ʊ/, as in "put"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a small curve underneath the character that points up as if it could hold water, e.g. कु</p>
            </span>
            
            <span>
                <p style="font-size: 150%">ū</p>
                <p>-pronounced "oo" /uː/, as in "room"</p>
                <p>appears on consonants as a similar under-curve, but points down and thus is NOT a good container, e.g. कू</p>
            </span>

            <p>There are technically more vowels, but they're not important, and their status as vowels is debated anyway. I won't be surprised if they go the way of Pluto.</p>

        <!--
        <h2>Consonants / व्यंजन</h2>
        <div class="chess-spannle-advanced">
            <p>Almost every consonant has non-aspirated and aspirated counterparts. Although those two are different, in the map, I will treat them as the same because English lacks such distinctions.</p>
            <p>But other than that, consonants are much simpler, so I'm just gonna give you a list.</p>
            <p>k - क​</p>
            <p>g - ग​</p>
            <p>ng - ङ​</p>
            <p>ch - च​</p>
            <p>j - ज​</p>
            <p>t - त/ट​</p>
            <p>d - द/ड​​</p>
            <p>n - न​/ण​</p>
            <p>p - प​</p>
            <p>b - ब​</p>
            <p>m - म​</p>
            <p>h - ह​</p>
            <p>s - स​</p>
            <p>sh - श/ष​(they're technically different, but who cares)</p>
            <p>r - र​</p>
            <p>l - ल​</p>
            <p>f - फ़​</p>
            <p>z - ज़​</p>
            <p>v/w - व​(yes, I know it's weird, they're the same letter)</p>
            <p>rd - ड़ (like in "bard")</p>
            <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Although consonants at the end of words are in their default form, the vowel "uh" is NOT pronounced. e.g. कल is pronounced "kal", NOT "kala"</p>
            <h3>One More Thing!</h3>
            <p>When consonants are put together they the first one is cut in half and the second is attached, e.g. "stā" would be स्ता (notice the connection of स and त?)</p>
        </div>
        -->

        <p>Now, unless you're really good at memorisation (like me), then you should probably keep this tab open as a reference.</p>
        <p>Wondering where the consonants are? Well you'll find them in the rest of the map! Have fun playing!</p>
